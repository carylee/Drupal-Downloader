==DESCRIPTION
Run this script to download Drupal (http://drupal.org) along with a list of modules
This script uses Drush for many of its tasks (http://drupal.org/project/drush)


==INSTRUCTIONS
At the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to install Drupal
Run this script in that directory

If you have Drush installed, the script will detect and use it.
If you don't, it will download it and delete it when it is done.

If you already have a folder with "drupal" in the name in a the directory you run the script in,
drupal_downloader.sh will assume that is a drupal installation and will install the modules
in it without downloading the Drupal code again.
